Additional Notes:
•	HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients): This feature extraction method is part of the Computer Vision Toolbox, allowing you to capture essential features from facial images, vital for distinguishing between male and female characteristics.
•	Custom Classification Method: In your project, you implemented a Euclidean distancebased classifier that differentiates gender by comparing extracted features from the live video feed against a preprocessed dataset of labeled images.
